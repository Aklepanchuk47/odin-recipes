        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>10 ounces fettuccini pasta</li>
                <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
                <Li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</Li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 egg yolk</li>
                <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet melt butter and add chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent garlic from burning.</li>
                <li>Pour about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream into a small bowl. Add egg yolk and beat together; set aside.</li>
                <li>Pour remaining cream into the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high. As cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Add egg mixture slowly to prevent curdling, whisking until well blended. Stir in 1 cup Parmesan cheese until combined.</li>
                <li>Add remaining Parmesan cheese and parsley; mix until smooth. Remove from heat and serve over cooked pasta.</li>
            </ol>
